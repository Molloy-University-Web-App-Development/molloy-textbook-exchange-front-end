      <p>(formerly CSC 244; CSC 144)</p>
      <p>
        Complementing CSC 2430, this course will have students implement
        abstract data types and derive solutions to a number of algorithmic
        problems, choosing the appropriate data structures to use and analyzing
        the space and time complexity of the approaches. Topics include stacks,
        queues, trees, hash maps, sets, bags and graphs.
